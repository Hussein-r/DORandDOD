DoD = Definition of Done

The DoD is usually a short document in the form of a checklist, that defines when a product backlog item is considered “done”

A typical DoD might look like this example:
Automated tests are written and all tests are green
Code is refactored and reviewed
Code is integrated with master branch
Deployed to staging environment
Translated into English and German

DoR = Definition of Ready

The DoR is the little cousin of the DoD. It is a checklist of what needs to be done to a product backlog item before the team can start implementing it in the next sprint. 

A typical DoR might look like this example:

PO and Dev Team need to have talked about the story at least once
Story must have clear business value
Effort needs to be estimated
Story must be broken down enough to fit a single sprint
Story needs at least one acceptance criterium
